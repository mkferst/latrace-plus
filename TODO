for 0.5.12
	- document the config file usage
	- config - arrays in structures
	- variable length argument output (printf like)
	- config - long/float/double support
	- segfault handling support (libSegFault.so loading support)
	- statistics for recursive calls
	- other LD_AUDIT interface functions utilization
	- statistics check

bugs
	- make waiting for child exit more robust (suspend/continue...)
	- library settings does not work properly
	- testing, segfaults with skype (test with simple LD_AUDIT lib)
	- test statistics counts
	- fifo reading more intelligent
	- detailed arguments buffer memory management (now fixed size)
	- environment variables to the include path
	- check we dont cross all the hardcoded limits
	- consolidate leveled VERBOSE output 
	- info doc (produce html, pdf... outputs)
	- * latrace crash if struct transformer overrides definition of struct
	- * prevent multiple deferences of char *, i.e. char ** and char ***


Other:
	- Support for latrace_custom_struct_transformer only added into x86_64 arch support (and other changes)
	- Rigid assumptions made of 64 bit ELF objects in transformer libraries
	- * Allow all type definitions to be overridden by most recent declaration
	- Suppress identical output lines?
	- * New library loads should trigger symbol load
	- Support for calling existing signal handlers for SIGILL/SIGSEGV/SIGBUS which are overwritten
	- * get rid of old bm_enum declaration type
	- * /p switch should allow any struct pointer to be displayed as a memory address
	- Should probably reap old thread_buffers
	- * User override of transformers dir with environment variable
