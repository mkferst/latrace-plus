for 0.5.12
	- document the config file usage
	- config - arrays in structures
	- variable length argument output (printf like)
	- config - long/float/double support
	- statistics for recursive calls
	- other LD_AUDIT interface functions utilization
	- statistics check

bugs
	- make waiting for child exit more robust (suspend/continue...)
	- library settings does not work properly
	- test statistics counts
	- fifo reading more intelligent
	- detailed arguments buffer memory management (now fixed size)
	- check we dont cross all the hardcoded limits
	- consolidate leveled VERBOSE output 
	- info doc (produce html, pdf... outputs)
	- * everything should still compile fine without libunwind present
	- * error messages should be sent over pipe
	- enum keyword should be handled properly when present in function prototype

Other:
	- Support for latrace_custom_struct_transformer only added into x86_64 arch support (and other changes)
	- * Allow all type definitions to be overridden by most recent declaration
	- Suppress identical output lines?
	- * New library loads should trigger symbol load
	- Support for calling existing signal handlers for SIGILL/SIGSEGV/SIGBUS which are overwritten
	- Should probably reap old thread_buffers to prevent memory leakage (and fix efficiency bug)
	- ** add non-collapsible functions (_setjmp)
	- * tersely collapsed functions should not display nested functions of bare/fully collapsed functions
	- TSD should pass temporary heap for quick operations?
	- * Remove transformer call stack (replace with pltexit/inregs?)
	- replace other invocations of DEMANGLE()
	- * vastly improve custom heap efficiency
	- * transformer modules need methods for generating errors/warnings/info
	- * add optional address2string debugging option
